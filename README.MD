### Commit naming convention

In order to quickly identify challenges' related code changes a naming convention for commit subjects is implemented, this is composed by four parts:
1. Programming language name followed by a forward slash `/`.
2. Challenge day, which is made by an uppercase `D` followed by the number of the day and a forward slash `/` after it.
3. Challenge part, which is made by an uppercase `P` followed by the part number and a colon `:` after it.
4. Commit subject

e.g. `GO/D2/P2: Add first working implementation` is a commit subject for the part 2 of the day 2 challenge written in `go`.
